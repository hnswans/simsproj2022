Catalogs 

Often, your best bet will be print catalogs for the collections in question. Sometimes these catalog entries have been transferred over to an online catalog. This is frequently not the case. More often, the catalogs are available as a PDF or e-book (such as through archive.org or HathiTrust), which have the benefits of being searchable. Some catalogs are only available in print.

Approaches to catalogs

1) Searching for keywords (when catalog is searchable)

This is a great approach, with a few caveats. One is the importance of transliteration. Some search engines are good at returning results with diacritics to a query with no diacritics, but try a few variations if you are having trouble getting results. You may not get results if you search by call number. Another is that some searchable catalogs have not yet copied over all their manuscripts.

2) Using indexes

Most catalogs will have an index by author and an index by title. Tables of contents do sometimes exist but may not be in categories useful to you if, for example, they are sorted by donor, or (as sometimes happens with with Victorian catalogs) the table of contents only lists histories by period and does not catalog other texts. If the indexes are in Latin script, be careful with transliteration as always.

3) Browsing

Older catalogs may lack indexes organizing titles by work or author. In this case, you will need to flip through manually. While this is time-intensive, this approach can yield interesting and unexpected results.
