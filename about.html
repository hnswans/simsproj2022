<h2 id="introducing-the-romance">Introducing the ‘Romance’</h2>

<p>The term ‘romance’, while not uncontroversial, refers to works known in Persian and Indic languages as qissah or dastan (‘story’), or masnavi (story in rhyming couplets), sometimes prefixed with the modifier ashiqi or romantic when they primarily concern one pair of lovers. They are distinguished by a few factors: a possible frametale story about a pair of lovers separated by cruel circumstance; and fantastical or supernatural elements, including fairies, demons, and zoomorphic transformations. They also serve as moral instruction.</p>

<p>[time/place]</p>

<p>These stories were popular throughout India from the fourteenth century onwards. The romance can be seen as having two lineages: the animal fable or frametale story that made its way from Sanskrit to Persian and Arabic in the [CENTURY]; and the Sufi romantic allegory as popularized by the masnavis of the Persian poet Nizami and adapted by writers affiliated with Sufi orders in the thirteenth century. While the Tutinama, Haft Sair-i Hatim and Bahar-i Danish are frame stories, Vamiq va Azra and the Gulshan-i Ishq focus on one pair of lovers, with digressions and subplots.</p>

<p>Romances circulated in almost every language in North India, including Persian, which continued to be a language of administration and high literature into the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>[Sufism]</p>

<p>As well as sources of education and entertainment in different languages, the stories also served to inculcate reader-listeners into certain Sufi-inflected ideas and sensibilities. The frametale lovers who meet only to be separated by a series of challenges serve as an allegory for the Sufi initiate’s path towards reaching God. The lover is motivated by an initial moment of intimacy and identification with the beloved (here symbolizing God), but then must work hard to overcome challenges to discipline themselves before they can be reunited. This may include a period of wandering. The story’s ending with an eventual reunion, sometimes is symbolized by marriage and sometimes by death, marks the Sufi concept of fanaa or destruction of the self within God.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the more fantastical elements of the stories can also be seen as serving a religiously didactic purpose. Sometimes these fit directly into a moral about supporting and trusting Sufi figures, as in the Gulshan-i Ishq, where a Sufi saint named Roshan-i Dil sparks the story by leading to the conception of the main character, and later helps him defeat a demon through the gift of a magic ring. At other times, the inclusion of figures like fairies and jinns maps on to an Islamic cosmology of nonhuman beings. As Pasha Khan and Nur Sobers-Khan have shown, stories and images of unusual beings and supposedly magical occurrences worked to inculcate ajaib or wonder at the possibilities of God’s creation.</p>

<p>Finally, aspects of the stories can be seen as training their reader-listeners in virtuous behavior. The story of Hatim Tai, the Tutinama, and the Bahar-i Danish consist of embedded and interwoven hikayat or stories that illustrate valorized behavior, for example….</p>

<p>This didactic purpose, as well as their entertainment value, led to these versatile stories’ use in different contexts.</p>

<h2 id="tracing-manuscripts-movements">Tracing Manuscripts’ Movements</h2>

<p>In an age when solitary, silent reading was not widespread, the manuscripts recorded by the project were mostly consumed by multiple people at once.</p>

<h3 id="education-and-entertainment-in-eighteenth-century-south-asia">Education and Entertainment in Eighteenth-Century South Asia</h3>

<p>Some, such as Inayatullah’s Bahar-i Danish, were specifically designed for educational contexts: Inayatullah, a court secretary, used the device of the romance to show off his ornate Persian and create a textbook for boys who needed to learn the language to succeed in the court bureaucracy. Similarly, the Tutinama [give info about the original here] was abridged in [YEAR] by [PERSON] to make it more comprehensible and easier to employ in educational contexts.</p>

<p>Discuss the many examples in Punjab catalog???</p>

<p>Other stories seem to have circulated in court contexts. This is certainly true of the Tutinama in its non-abridged version, which circulated in sumptuously-illustrated court copies including the monumental one commissioned by the Mughal Emperor Akbar in the sixteenth century, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art [CHECK]. Meanwhile the Gulshan-i Ishq, originally composed by a court poet in [Bijapur?] and dedicated to Ibrahim Adil Shah, mostly survives in illustrated manuscripts, which would have been expensive, elite objects. Many of them employ similar compositions to illustrate the same episodes, suggesting a practice of group reading informed by consumption of the images.</p>

<h3 id="the-advent-of-the-east-india-trading-companies">The Advent of the East India Trading Companies</h3>

<p>When officials affiliated with the East India Company and other trading companies began arriving in India from the seventeenth century, their use of these stories and their manuscripts followed that by local elites. Illustrated books were valuable prized possessions, either given to cement relationships or bought and sold, while rougher copies were used and frequently marked up in the course of learning Persian from local teachers who were used to employing the stories for this purpose. A copy of the Bahar-i Danish bound together with a basic list of Persian verb conjugations and wrapped up in a lithographed Urdu textbook (Princeton OBJECT ID), and [ABRIDGED] Tutinama xxx, attest to this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Fine manuscripts were housed in large libraries by rulers, and changed hands as dynasties were absorbed or conquered. Tipu Sultan, ruler of Mysore from 1782-1799, had a substantial library of around 2000 books largely composed of works taken from the courts of Bijapur, Golconda and Chittoor, which his father, Hyder Ali, had absorbed a generation earlier. Among these were an illustrated Gulshan-i Ishq from one of the Deccan courts, now held in the Free Library of Philadelphia. In a continuation of this process, When the East India Company defeated Tipu in the Anglo-Mysore War of 1798-9, their soldiers looted the contents of his court at Seringapatam, including his library. Many manuscripts were sent to Calcutta, of which 600 ended up in the British Library. Others remain in the Asiatic Society in Calcutta, and yet more are dispersed around the world, for example in the case of the Philadelphia Gulshan.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-oriental-archive-in-european-libraries">Building the ‘Oriental’ Archive in European Libraries</h3>

<p>As the East India Company’s control of local institutions grew, so its administrators had greater opportunities to acquire Indian manuscripts. The Bodleian hosts some of the oldest manuscripts recorded in the project, numbered Ouseley for the brothers Sir William Ouseley (1767-1842) and Sir Gore Ouseley (1770-1844). Both were Orientalists; Sir William studied Persian in Europe, acquiring several hundred manuscripts in London, while Sir Gore was posted in Lucknow, where he collected illustrated and illuminated Indian manuscripts. The two brothers travelled to Persia as ambassadors and also acquired manuscripts there. Sir William’s collection of Persian manuscripts was purchased by the Bodleian in 1843; Sir Gore’s manuscripts were purchased by Mr J.B. Elliot, a Bengal civil servant, who then presented them to the Bodleian, uniting the two Ouseley collections.</p>

<p>Other European libraries also hold manuscripts collected by Orientalists. Aloys Sprenger (1813-1893), an Austrian Orientalist who catalogued the royal libraries in Lucknow from 1848-9 and also served as secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society and principal of the Delhi College, amassed a significant private collection of Arabic, Persian and Urdu manuscripts over his various appointments. After moving to Germany towards the end of his life, he sold them to the Berlin Public Library, where they remain numbered ‘Sprenger’.</p>

<p>After the Uprising of 1857, the British government deemed the looted property of anyone found to be ‘guilty of any offence for which their property would be liable for forfeiture’ to remain property of the colonial state. British officials known as the ‘Delhi Prize Agents’ were responsible for auctioning off property seized during the violence of 1857. As Nur Sobers-Khan has recently pointed out, much of the British Library’s ‘Delhi Collection’ seems to be remnants of a private library of a scholar, ‘liable for forfeiture’ due to his association with anticolonial scholars, bought at auction by the British government.

<p>By the second half of the nineteenth century, with the European traffic in Indian manuscripts firmly established, collectors were able to acquire many works within Europe. The greatest donor to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences’ collection of Persian manuscripts (170 texts in total) was Alexander Kegl’s (1862-1920) donation of 59 volumes, which also included some in Hindustani. While Kegl, a scholar of Persian, did make one trip to Iran in 1889, the bulk of his collection (and the Academy’s as a whole) is comprised of books from India. Kegl made most of his acquisitions via booksellers based in England selling Indian manuscripts. These include a Bahar-i Danish (supplemented with eight other works) previously owned by Danish literary historian Harald Rasmussen (1853–1904). A number of Indian-made manuscripts can be traced back to the British East India Company through owner’s marks. According to cataloguer Iván Szántó, a flyleaf note on a Tutinama donated by Kegl suggests that “during the late 18th century the manuscript belonged to the collection of Prince Amīr al-Umarā, the second son and commander-in-chief of the Navāb Vallāǧa (1749–1795) of Karnataka. Amīr al-Umarā, in turn, presented it to Job Bulman (1754–1818), a Briton from Northumberland who was mentioned in 1773 as surgeon at the Madras court.” According to Szántó, the Bahar-i Danish and the Tutinama held special interest for Kegl as he acquired two copies of each (the only other work with two copies being the Akbarnama).</p>

<h3 id="the-oriental-library-in-america">The ‘Oriental Library’ in America</h3>

<p>In America, the collection of manuscripts termed ‘Oriental’ or ‘Islamic’ began in the late nineteenth century, concordant with the establishment of Near Eastern or Oriental Studies departments at universities. Their manuscript collections were bolstered by wealthy patrons who turned to the book trade. An example is Alexander Cotheal (1804-1894), heir to a well-known New York shipping firm, who served as director of the American Oriental Society and president of the American Ethnological Society. Cotheal donated his collection to Columbia University’s Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library before his death; in 1986, the same year the University formed a dedicated department for ‘Oriental languages,’ Cotheal’s two widowed sisters (his only surviving heirs) established the Cotheal Fund for the Increase of the Library, which was to be used for books in Oriental languages. 1896 was also the same date the college became a University, moved to a more spacious campus, and began construction of the grand and spacious Low Library.</p>

<p>Examining Cotheal’s material interventions in Columbia X892.8 Ad9, MS Or 374, and X892.8T88 O, I argue that while Anglophone reader-owners of Indo-Persian medieval texts in the early colonial period engaged with them in continuity with Indian reader-owners (using them to learn Persian through stories), when they entered the auction house and the library, the social lives of these texts ended. Pre-modern Persian manuscripts were seen as objects of anthropological study, rather than offering tools for language study and the development of ethics. This move allowed the modern institution of the library to distance itself from ‘premodern’ forms of knowledge, while laying claim to represent those knowledge forms authoritatively.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, 
within South Asia</p>

<p>National archives…
Often, these are undercatalogued (a problem that also plagues European archives).</p>

<p>The purpose of this project is to trace a small selection of Indo-Persian romance manuscripts in archives globally, to get a sense of their movement and circulation.</p>
